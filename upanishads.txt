=========

Mahesh Yogi's Jabala Upanishad claims to be from Atharva Veda;
but the Muktika canon lists *two* Jabala Upanishads: one from
Shukla YV and the other from Sama Veda ! The one from Sama Veda
is classified as Shaiva Upanishad. This gives more emphasis on
mediation and the chanting of Rudra.

Gopala Tapani is commented upon mostly by Gaudiya school. Wikipedia
says it's likely a 13th or 14th century work. Nrsimha-tapani is probably
the oldest of 4 "tapani" Upanishads since Adi-Shankara is said to have
written a commentary on it. (See SBE, Upanishads-II Introduction)

Amritabindu has just 22 verses. Kriya-yoga?

Atma-(pra)bodha Upanishad discusses Narayana Ashtakshara Mantra even though
it is classified as a "Samanya Upanishad".

Among the biggest Upanishds (other than those listed above):
Shivopan, Maha(t) Upanishad, Narada Parivrajaka, Tripadvibhuti,
Tejobindu, Yogashiksha, Nrsimha Tapani, Maha Narayana, Ramarahasya,
Shandilya, Kaushitaki, Brihaj-jabala, Jabala darsana, Rama tapani, Yajniki, etc.

The Paingala Upanishad seems Vishu-glorifying. Contains
statements from Vishnu Sukta. Paingala is also quoted by Adi Shankara.

Subala Upan is the teaching of Sage Angiras to Sage Raikva. It tries 
to answer the question of the time and method of creation of the world.
Discusses properties of the soul of beings.
Narayana is glorified as the Supreme. Expands upon the Purusha Sukta
and the meaning of Gayatri Mantra.
http://www.vedarahasya.net/subala.htm

Mahat Upanishad (aka Maha Upanishad aka Mahopanishad aka Mahad Upan):
Describes the initial creation of the universe, starting From Lord Narayana to Lord
Brahma. After this, there is a discussion between Sage Suka and King Janaka regarding the
creation of the Samsara. This is followed by a discussion of several aspects of philosophy
between Sage Nidhaka and his guru, Sage Ripu. It explains that the Sastras are burden for
a Jnani, Jnana is a burden to those who are attached, and so on.

NONE of the verses cited by Madhva from MahaUpanishad are available in today's extant version.
(See pg 11 of response to Mesquita's Unknown Sources by Shrisha Rao/BNK Sharma)
(See also https://sites.google.com/site/harshalarajesh/madhvacharyaslibrary)

Kaivalya Up is mostly Shiva-glorifying. Also quoted by Adi Shankara.

Vajrasuchika condemns caste-by-birth.

Yogatattva and Yogakundalini are Hatha-yoga related.

Atharvashikha[1] is a very small upanishad exploring the meaning of OM (A U M).

### Dvaita version

Dvaita [2] says that "Narayana Upanishad" is the 10th chaper of Taittiriya
Aranyaka of Krishna Yajur Veda. However their version of Mahanarayana Upanishad
is that from the Atharva Veda, agrees with the version published by
Maharshi Mahesh Yogi's MUM website. Jacob's version as well as MUM's version
both have 25 khandas. Sri Dheerendra Teertharu has written a commentary
on Narayana Upanishad [3]. However the version of Mahanarayana published
by Ramakrishna Math follows YajurVedic version.


The 10 principal Upanishads are: Isha, Kena, Katha, Prashna,
Mundaka, Mandukya, Aitareya, Taittiriya, Chandogya and
Brihadaranyaka. The remaining ones depend on which school of
thought you subscribe to and/or personal preferences. They
generally include Shvetashvatara, Kaushitaki, Maitrayaniya,
Jabala, Paingala, Kaivalya, Mahanarayana, Amrita-bindu,
Gopala-Tapani, etc. (in order of popularity AFAIK)


EXTRACT FROM RADHAKRISHNAN's BOOK:
http://www.uramamurthy.com/u_intro1.html

Prince Muhammad Dara Shikoh's collection translated into Persian (1656-1657) and then into
Latin by Anquetil Duperron (1801 and 1802) under the title Oupnekhat, contained about
fifty. Colebrooke's collection contained fifty-two, and this was based on nArAyaNa's list
(c. A.D. 1400). The principal upaniShads are said to be ten. shankara commented on eleven,
Isa, kena, kaTha, prasna, muNDaka, mANDUkya, taittirIya, aitareya, chAndogya,
bRhad-AraNyaka and svetAsvatara. He also refers to the kauShItakI, jAbAla, mahAnArAyaNa
and paingala upaniShads in his commentary on the brahma sUtra. These together with the
maitrAyaNIya or maitrI upaniShad constitute the principal upaniShads. rAmAnuja uses all
these upaniShads as also the subAla and the cUlika. He cites ONCE the garbha, the
jAbAla and the mahA upaniShads. vidyAraNya includes nrsimhottara-tApanI upaniShad among
the twelve he explained in his sarvopaniShad-arthAnubhUti-prakAsa. The other upaniShads
which have come down are more religious than philosophical. They belong more to the purANa
and the tantra than to the veda. They glorify vedAnta or yoga or sanyAsa or extol the
worship of siva, sakti or viShNu. [ There is, however, considerable argument about the
older and more original upaniShads. Max Müller translated the elevan upaniShads quoted by
shankara together with maitrAyaNIya. Deussen, though he translated no less than sixty,
considers that fourteen of them are original and have a connection with Vedic
schools. Hume translated the twelve which Max Müller selected and added to them the
mAndUkya. Keith in his Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and upaniShads includes the
mahAnArAyaNa. His list of fourteen is the same as that of Deussen.]
